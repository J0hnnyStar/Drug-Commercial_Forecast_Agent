# James Zou Evaluation Framework for AI Systems

## Overview
Based on James Zou's research at Stanford (2024-2025) on AI evaluation criteria, bias detection, and reliability assessment, this framework implements rigorous evaluation standards for our agentic pharmaceutical AI system.

## Core Evaluation Principles

### 1. Bias Detection and Fairness
James Zou's recent work on AI detector bias highlights critical evaluation needs:

#### Population Diversity Requirements
- **Multi-demographic Testing**: Test system across different user populations
- **Language Bias Assessment**: Evaluate performance across native vs non-native speakers  
- **Domain Expertise Bias**: Test with varying levels of pharmaceutical knowledge
- **Geographic Bias**: Validate across different regulatory environments

#### Our Implementation
```python
bias_test_scenarios = {
    "user_expertise": ["novice", "intermediate", "expert"],
    "language_background": ["native", "non_native"], 
    "therapeutic_areas": ["oncology", "respiratory", "immunology"],
    "market_regions": ["US", "EU", "emerging_markets"]
}
```

### 2. Reliability and Robustness Assessment

#### Zou's Virtual Scientists Methodology
- **Hypothesis Generation Quality**: AI should generate testable, novel hypotheses
- **Critical Thinking Assessment**: Evaluate reasoning chains and logical consistency
- **Scientific Rigor**: Maintain standards equivalent to human expert evaluation

#### Our Pharmaceutical Implementation
- **Parameter Estimation Reliability**: Consistency across similar drug scenarios
- **Market Analysis Robustness**: Stable predictions under input variations
- **Investment Decision Quality**: Alignment with expert pharmaceutical analysts

### 3. Representative Data and Evaluation Metrics

#### Zou's Key Insight
"AI algorithms are often developed on non-representative samples and evaluated based on narrow metrics"

#### Our Response
- **Comprehensive Scenario Coverage**: 100+ diverse pharmaceutical cases
- **Multi-dimensional Metrics**: Beyond accuracy to include explainability, speed, bias
- **Real-world Validation**: Compare against actual pharmaceutical outcomes

## Quantitative Evaluation Framework

### Primary Zou-Inspired Metrics

| Metric Category | Measurement | Zou's Principle |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Bias Resistance** | Performance variance across demographics | "AI detectors biased against non-native speakers" |
| **Reliability Consistency** | Prediction stability across similar scenarios | "Virtual scientists critical thinking" |
| **Representative Coverage** | Scenario diversity in test set | "Non-representative sample problem" |
| **Explainability Depth** | Reasoning chain completeness | "Scientific rigor maintenance" |

### Statistical Validation Requirements

#### Hypothesis Testing (Zou's Standards)
- **Primary Hypothesis**: Our AI system reduces bias compared to SOTA methods
- **Statistical Power**: Minimum 80% power to detect medium effect sizes
- **Multiple Testing Correction**: Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons
- **Confidence Intervals**: 95% CI for all performance claims

#### Sample Size Calculations
- **Bias Detection**: n=200 per demographic group (power analysis)
- **Reliability Testing**: n=500 pharmaceutical scenarios minimum
- **Cross-validation**: 10-fold CV for stable estimates
