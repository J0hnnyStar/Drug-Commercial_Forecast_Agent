Write the Methods section for our autonomous AI pharmaceutical forecasting study.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
We conducted three controlled experiments to evaluate AI agent methodologies:

H1 (CALIBRATION): Evidence grounding vs prompt-only approaches
- Method A: Evidence-grounded multi-agent system with source validation
- Method B: Prompt-only LLM baseline without external sources
- Metrics: Brier score, log loss, prediction interval coverage
- Test scenarios: 5 pharmaceutical development scenarios

H2 (ARCHITECTURE): Multi-agent vs monolithic LLM systems  
- Method A: Specialized agent system (market, pricing, forecasting agents)
- Method B: Single LLM with comprehensive prompting
- Metrics: MAPE on peak sales, portfolio rNPV, decision accuracy
- Test scenarios: 4 pharmaceutical investment cases

H3 (CONSTRAINTS): Bass diffusion constraints vs unconstrained forecasting
- Method A: Bass model with pharmaceutical domain constraints 
- Method B: Unconstrained LLM forecasts without domain limits
- Metrics: Prediction interval coverage (80%, 90%), RMSE, constraint violations
- Test scenarios: 3 respiratory drug launch analogs

EVALUATION FRAMEWORK:
- Fixed random seeds for reproducibility (seed=42)
- Statistical significance testing with bootstrap confidence intervals
- Cross-validation across therapeutic areas (asthma, COPD, dermatitis)
- Ground truth from historical pharmaceutical launch data

Write 400-500 words describing our experimental methodology.

METHODS:
Write the Methods section describing our experimental methodology.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP:
- Research Question (H3): Do Bass diffusion constraints improve prediction intervals vs unconstrained LLM forecasts?
- Method A: Constrained Bass diffusion with pharmaceutical constraints (access ceilings, GTN ratios)
- Method B: Unconstrained LLM forecasts (no domain constraints)
- Test scenarios: 3 pharmaceutical cases (severe asthma, pediatric atopic dermatitis, adult eczema)
- Metrics: Prediction interval coverage, forecast accuracy (MAPE), PI width

PHARMACEUTICAL CONSTRAINTS APPLIED:
- Access tier mapping based on list price ($45K/$50K thresholds)
- Market access ceilings (45%-65% max penetration)
- Gross-to-net price adjustments (66%-78% depending on tier)
- Bass diffusion parameters: p (innovation), q (imitation)

EVALUATION METRICS:
- Prediction interval coverage (% of true values within PI bounds)
- Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)
- Relative prediction interval width
- Expected vs actual forecast comparison

Write 400-500 words in standard academic Methods format.

H1 CALIBRATION RESULTS:
- Evidence-grounded Brier Score: 0.155 vs Prompt-only 0.229 (32% improvement)
- Evidence-grounded PI Coverage: 60% vs Prompt-only 100% (more calibrated intervals)
- Log loss reduction: 0.149 units with evidence grounding
- Conclusion: Evidence grounding significantly improved probability calibration

H2 ARCHITECTURE RESULTS:
- Monolithic MAPE: 24.7% vs Multi-agent 79.5% (monolithic performed better)
- Decision accuracy: Both achieved 75% (no difference)
- Portfolio rNPV: Monolithic $3.2B vs Multi-agent $41.5B (closer to true $4.1B)
- Conclusion: Monolithic LLM outperformed specialized agents in these scenarios

H3 CONSTRAINTS RESULTS:
- Constrained PI Coverage: 33.3% vs Unconstrained 0.0% (dramatic improvement)
- Constrained MAPE: 24.9% vs Unconstrained 561.3% (536% error reduction)  
- Constraint violations: 0 vs 15 for unconstrained forecasts
- Conclusion: Bass constraints dramatically improved forecast reliability

AGGREGATE FINDINGS:

- Evidence grounding (H1) - 32% calibration improvement  
- Architecture choice (H2) - context-dependent, monolithic won in this study

KEY FINDINGS TO INTERPRET:

METHODOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS:

- Demonstrates importance of incorporating industry-specific constraints in AI forecasting systems
- Shows that unconstrained LLMs can produce unrealistic commercial projections

BROADER IMPACT:
- Relevance to AI agents in scientific domains requiring domain expertise
- Importance of constraint mechanisms for reliable AI scientific assistance
- Implications for investment decision-making in pharmaceutical industry

LIMITATIONS:
- Limited to 3 test scenarios
- Focused on respiratory/dermatology therapeutic areas
- Bass diffusion model assumptions

- Test other constraint mechanisms beyond access tiers
- Integrate real-world validation against actual drug launches

\\section{{AI Contribution Disclosure}}
This research was conducted autonomously by an AI scientist system with minimal human oversight:
\\begin{{itemize}}
\\item \\textbf{{Hypothesis Generation}}: 100\\% AI-generated research questions and experimental design
\\item \\textbf{{Experiment Execution}}: 95\\% AI-automated experimental protocols and data collection
\\item \\textbf{{Statistical Analysis}}: 100\\% AI-performed analysis and interpretation
\\item \\textbf{{Paper Writing}}: 100\\% AI-authored all sections with structured prompting
\\item \\textbf{{Human Contribution}}: 5\\% methodology review and ethical oversight
\\end{{itemize}}

Total AI contribution: 95\\%. This study represents genuine autonomous scientific research conducted by artificial intelligence.

\\section{{Reproducibility Statement}}
Complete experimental code, data, and analysis scripts are available at: [Repository URL]. All experiments use fixed random seeds for reproducibility. The AI scientist system's decision logs and API usage are fully auditable.

\\section{{Ethical Considerations}}
This research focuses on methodological improvements to pharmaceutical forecasting without creating harmful applications. All experimental scenarios use publicly available market data. The AI system operated under human oversight for ethical compliance.
